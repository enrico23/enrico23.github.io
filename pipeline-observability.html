									<h1>From Ephemeral Metrics to Durable Signals</h1>
								</header>
								<p><strong>Case Study — Delivery Intelligence (CI/CD)</strong></p>
								<p>
									In a previous role, our CI/CD metrics were effective at answering immediate
									operational questions (“what just broke?”), but insufficient for answering
									long-horizon ones:
								</p>

								<ul>
									<li>Were pipelines getting faster or slower over time?</li>
									<li>Were changes improving delivery, or shifting bottlenecks?</li>
									<li>Was additional test coverage still generating proportional confidence?</li>
								</ul>

								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pipeline-observability.jpg" alt="" /></div>

								<h3>Context</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Multi-team environment with high deployment frequency.</li>
									<li>CI/CD telemetry retained for short windows and optimised for real-time dashboards.</li>
									<li>Delivery conversations frequently reset once historical context expired.</li>
								</ul>

								<p>
									The system was optimised for reacting to incidents, not for understanding delivery
									climate over months.
								</p>

								<h3>Problem Reframing</h3>
								<p>
									The issue was not a lack of dashboards. It was treating delivery metrics as
									short-lived telemetry rather than durable data.
								</p>

								<p>
									Without historical continuity, long-term delivery decisions were being made
									from short-term signals.
								</p>

								<h3>Ownership</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Reframed CI/CD metrics as decision-support data rather than incident-support telemetry.</li>
									<li>Defined which signals were worth persisting beyond default retention windows.</li>
									<li>Established a long-term storage and aggregation approach to enable trend analysis.</li>
								</ul>

								<h3>Implementation Approach</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Persisted key delivery metrics (pipeline duration, test phase duration, failure rates, deployment frequency).</li>
									<li>Normalised metrics to allow cross-team comparison over time.</li>
									<li>Focused on monthly and quarterly trend analysis rather than real-time dashboards.</li>
								</ul>

								<p>
									The goal was not more visualisation. It was stable context.
								</p>

								<h3>Tradeoffs</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Additional upfront effort to define metric semantics clearly.</li>
									<li>Acceptance that durable analysis would not be instant.</li>
									<li>Operational ownership of metric integrity over time.</li>
								</ul>

								<h3>Insights That Emerged</h3>
								<p>
									With durable history, patterns became visible that short retention windows
									had masked.
								</p>

								<ul>
									<li>Integration test coverage growth correlated with increasing build times.</li>
									<li>Time-to-production slowed as full test suites expanded.</li>
									<li>Failure rate improvements did not scale proportionally with execution cost.</li>
								</ul>

								<p>
									This was not evidence that testing was harmful. It was evidence of diminishing
									marginal confidence from blanket execution strategies.
								</p>

								<h3>Impact</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Enabled evidence-based discussion about selective test execution strategies.</li>
									<li>Made throughput vs confidence tradeoffs explicit.</li>
									<li>Shifted delivery conversations from intuition-driven to data-grounded.</li>
									<li>Provided longitudinal visibility that influenced ongoing optimisation decisions.</li>
								</ul>

								<h3>Why It Matters</h3>
								<p>
									Short-term metrics help teams react. <br />
									Durable metrics help organisations decide.
								</p>

								<p>
									By treating CI/CD data as durable infrastructure rather than disposable telemetry,
									we improved the quality of delivery decisions and reduced reliance on anecdotal reasoning.
